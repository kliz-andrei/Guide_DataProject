# B. Data Analysis Project Guide

## 1. Introduction

### **Purpose**
Define the objective of the analysis. Explain what you aim to achieve with the data, such as identifying trends, making predictions, or solving a specific problem.

### **Dataset Overview**
Provide a brief description of the dataset(s) used, including:
- Data sources
- Key variables
- Time range covered
- File formats (CSV, JSON, SQL, etc.)

## 2. Data Loading

### **Import Required Libraries**
Load essential Python libraries for data analysis.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### **Load Datasets**
Read the datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
```python
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

### **Initial Exploration**
Inspect the structure and first few rows of the dataset.
```python
df.info()
df.head()
```

## 3. Data Cleaning

### **Handling Missing Values**
Identify and address missing values.
```python
df.isnull().sum()
```
- Drop missing values: `df.dropna(inplace=True)`
- Impute missing values: `df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)`

### **Data Type Conversion**
Ensure proper data types.
```python
df['date_column'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date_column'])
```

### **Removing Duplicates**
```python
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
```

### **Standardizing Categorical Data**
Normalize categorical data (e.g., standardizing text formats).
```python
df['category'] = df['category'].str.lower().str.strip()
```

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **Descriptive Statistics**
Generate summary statistics.
```python
df.describe()
```

### **Visualizations**
Create basic plots for insights.
```python
sns.histplot(df['numeric_column'])
plt.show()
```
- **Boxplots** for outliers: `sns.boxplot(x=df['column'])`
- **Correlation heatmap**: `sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True)`

## 5. Feature Engineering

### **Creating New Features**
Derive new variables based on existing data.
```python
df['total_price'] = df['quantity'] * df['unit_price']
```

### **Encoding Categorical Variables**
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
```python
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['category'])
```

## 6. Data Analysis

### **Trend Analysis**
Identify patterns over time.
```python
df.groupby('date_column').sum().plot()
```

### **Segment Analysis**
Compare different groups within the dataset.
```python
df.groupby('category').mean()
```

### **Anomaly Detection**
Detect outliers.
```python
sns.boxplot(x=df['numeric_column'])
```

## 7. Modeling (If applicable)

### **Splitting the Data**
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### **Applying a Model**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### **Evaluating Model Performance**
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
```

## 8. Conclusion & Insights

### **Key Findings**
Summarize the insights from the analysis.

### **Recommendations**
Provide actionable recommendations based on findings.

### **Limitations**
Acknowledge any data constraints or limitations in the analysis.

## 9. Next Steps
Outline potential follow-up actions, such as:
- Collecting more data
- Refining models
- Automating reports
